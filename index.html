		<br>Hello! I'm currently the <b>Collections and Partnerships Coordinator</b> at the Center for Research Libraries, and an <b>Associate Lecturer</b> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In the past, I've worked for the <b>Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation</b>, <b>StoryCorps</b>, and <b>Culver's</b> (as the restaurants's first archivist). I have a Master's from the iSchool at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a Bachelor's in English from the University of Iowa. I developed the Madison Public Library's Personal Archiving Lab.

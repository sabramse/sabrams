		<title>Personal Archiving at the Madison Public Library</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>This coming year,</h1>
		<p>the Madison Public Library will furnish and debut a personal archiving lab, at which members of the Madison, Wisconsin community (and beyond) can digitize and preserve their home movies, documents, and photographs. The lab will be both mobile and easy-to-use, and will be at the center of several public programming events that help emphasize the importance of archival preservation and longevity.
			
			<br>
			<br>As the Public Library's practicum student, I will play a vital role in getting this project off the ground. I have been asked to write documentation for the personal archiving equipment purchased by the Library, so that members of the public (and Library staff) will be able to use the lab without constant guidance. I will also be in charge of developing public programming events involving the lab, many of which will resemble Madison's first <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1479792362325882/">Personal Archiving Day</a>, held in October of 2015. It is my goal, too, to secure funding for the lab for the immediate future, which will involve grant writing and advocacy on behalf of our project. 
			<br><br>The Library has also asked me to help spearhead their Web archiving initiatives, which will use Archive-It to collect and focus on hyper-local Madison sites that help explain where we, as a community, are at this point in time. The Web archive, in conjunction with the personal archiving lab, will emphasize the importance of archives and the roles they play in our community. 
			<br><br>The archival profession is one that should no longer be solitary and out of reach. Instead, let's make it a practice that occurs in homes, at libraries, at private and public companies, and on. If we give the individual, or the group, the power to control and preserve their own history, we expand the profession and turn it into something robust and vibrant. What we help create is an archive by the people, for the people, that exists to tell our truths as they happened during our lifetime. What could be better?

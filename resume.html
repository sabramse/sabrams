		<h3><u>Recent Experience</u>:</h3>
		
		<h4><b>Archivist</b> at <b>Culver's</b> / <b>May 2015</b> to <b>Present</b></h4>
			<br>
				Founded in 1984, Culver's is a family-oriented, Midwestern-based, 'fast-casual restaurant,' which operates over 550 locations in twenty-two states, and employs thousands. Since joining Culver's as the organization's first and only archivist, I: Developed and enacted a mission statement for the archive, which received approval from Culver's stakeholders, and outlines what the archive exists to document, collect, and preserve; Completed a full, item-level inventory of the Culver's collection, which amounts to approximately five-hundred cubic feet and contains audiovisual, paper-based, and three-dimensional materials; Assisted with the development of a digital media library &mdash; called 'Culver's in the News' &mdash; where Web clippings, videos, and presentations concerning Culver's are cataloged, uploaded, and stored for use by employees. In charge of cataloging each resource, I developed and maintain a Culver's-specific controlled vocabulary, and upload each piece of media to the SharePoint portal with relevant metadata adhering to Dublin Core standards; Directed the digitization of the organization's tape-based media, which amounted to one-hundred and twenty-two U-Matic, Digital Betacam, and VHS tapes. In support of the project, I prioritized digitization based on both deterioration and eventual use of our material, developed a two-year budget, wrote a request for proposal (which was sent to vendors across the country), and selected a vendor.

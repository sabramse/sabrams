		<h1>the phrase 'space wanderer' comes from</h1>
		
		<p> a 1971 letter that kurt vonnegut wrote to his daughter, nan. in it, he writes:</p><br>
		
		<p><p><i><blockquote>dear old nanno -</i></p>
		
		<p><i>you're learning now that you do not inhabit a solid, reliable, social structure -- that the older you get people around you are worried, moody, goofy human beings who themselves were little kids only a few days ago. so home can fall apart and schools can fall apart, usually for childish reasons, and what have you got? a space wanderer named nan. and that's ok. i'm a space wanderer named kurt, and jane's a space wanderer named jane, and so on. when things go well for days on end it is an hilarious accident.</blockquote></i></p>
